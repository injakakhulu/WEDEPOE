events, and community activities.

To provide a one stop digital platform for discovering and sharing events across 
South Africa. 
Target Audience  
Urban residents aged 18 +, youth for community and church gathering aged 
16+, local event organisers, tourists seeking weekend activities, and small 
businesses hosting pop-up events. 
Website Goals and Objectives 
• Increase Website Traffic: Achieve 1,500 unique monthly visitors within 
the first six months of launch. 
• Centralise event listings in a clean, user friendly interface.

• Bounce rate (aiming for under 40%). 
• Average session duration (minimum of 2 minutes). 
• User satisfaction via post-event surveys (target: 80%+ positive feedback). 
Current Website Analysis 
Currently, ThisWeekend operates through social media posts, limiting 
discoverability and searchability. No centralised event database exists, making 
it hard to track events efficiently. 
• Strengths: Quick updates, basic audience reach, and low operational 
costs. 
Weaknesses: 
• Limited search functionality for events. 
• Posts get buried in feeds and lack structured categorisation. 
• No analytics or tracking for visitor engagement. 
• Limited branding opportunities and poor user navigation 
Areas for Improvement 
• Centralised platform for all events with a clear navigation structure. 
• Search and filter functionality for quick event discovery. 
• Consistent branding and mobile responsiveness. 
• Integration of analytics tools for performance tracking.
